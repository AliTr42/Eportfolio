                    <h1>Hello, my name is Ali dereli</h1>
                    <h3>I am an IT field student from Belgium</h3>
                    <p>
                        
                        At primary school, I was a solitary, calm and quiet child who did not cause much trouble, I think it was because I was the youngest in the class as I started primary school when I was only five. The secondary school did not go badly either until my 4th year. Indeed, that year I had to retake some exams. It was my first time, so it was tough. After this incident, I had to pull myself together and work more seriously.  
                    </p>
                        Growing up, my family taught me the importance of honesty, hard work, and kindness, values that have been since then building my character.  Being born with two nationalities (Belgian and Turkish) has also significantly enriched my life and identity. Different cultural influences and perspectives have shaped my world perception.
                        
                    <p>
                         Since my childhood I always wanted to become an engineer, I do think that is also because I always wanted to make my parents proud. My family and my friends have been massively important to my evolution because they have always been an example for me.
                    </p> 
                    <p>
                        What about my hobbies, I enjoy playing football with my friends, which gives me energy and helps me relieve stress. When I am with people, I am more energetic, but when I get home, I often feel tired. At times like that, if I decide to play a game, I prefer to play adventure games, especially when I am playing alone. Football and video games, especially adventure games, are my favourite pastimes, as they both offer social activity and a solo escape that gives me joy and relaxation.

                       <h5>I will give you 5 Qualities about myself.</h5> 

                    </p><p>
                        My creativity is one of my main forces. I love exploring new ideas, connecting different concepts, and finding innovative solutions to problems. For example, I had to do a project using an example, finally I have done the project but, in my ways, using my method.
                    </p><p>
                        Respect is a fundamental value that guides my daily interactions. I believe in equality and dignity for all. Even in stressful situations, I always give importance to maintain a respectful communication and actively listen to divergent viewpoint.
</p><p>
                        Patience is a quality that I improve over	time. I understand the importance of giving others the time they need to express themselves. For example, in my personal relationship, I have always taken the time to resolve arguments constructively.
                    </p><p>

                        I do think that I am an empathetic person, I try to understand and share the feelings of other. For instance, once during a project I noticed that one of my teammates was struggling. So, I took time to empathize and help him with his problem.
                    </p><p>
                        I think that I have good adaptability skills, I can quickly adjust my approach to meet new challenges or new environments for example, in one of my projects I did not have the right component so quickly I ordered a new one and so we had the time to finish our task.
                        </p>
