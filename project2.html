                    <h3>Project Multidisplinary 2</h3>
                    <p>In Multidisciplinary Project 2, our group took on a big project, including classes in "Web Language 2," "Technical English," "Project Management," "Embedded Systems," and "Database." Our main objective was to use cylinders of different heights to determine the depth of Lego blocks. An Arduino, a conveyor belt, proximity and depth sensors, an LCD screen, and a reset button were all part of the embedded system. We developed a website featuring a dashboard and history page for the web component, linked it to a database, and used Docker to expedite startup. Leandre Karasavas, Jerome Sartiaux, and I worked as a three-person team to successfully meet a one-week deadline, developing important experience in time management and teamwork alongside our technical skills. This project offered us an enriching experience through implementing academic knowledge into practice.

                        To speak about personal experiences, I found it difficult to manage time because we only had one week to finish all the work. therefore, we learned more about teamwork and, above all, working efficiently. We also encountered some problems, there were no sensors to fit the hole in the Lego bricks, so we had to find it ourselves. Another problem that we had was that our proximity sensors were bugging, so sometimes they would recognize the Lego bricks but sometimes they wouldn't. The presentation of our project was also challenging because we had to present all of it in English and it was our first time. Despite all those problems, we still managed to carry out the project and make the presentation a real success.
