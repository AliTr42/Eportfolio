                    <h1>Here is our first project</h1>
                    <h3>Project Multidisplinary 1</h3>
                    <p>In Multidisciplinary Project 1, my team and I had to carry out a project, that included knowledge like electronics and C language programming. Our main objective was to create a game using two dice. Me and my teammates decided to choose a game in which every person who played threw both dice and added up the numbers. If they exceeded 55, the person would lose. therefore, regarding the electronics part, we had to use 12 LEDs to display the dice numbers. What about the programming part, we had to write in a code that suited the game we created. Finally, we needed to connect the electronics part and the programming part but unfortunately, nobody had the time to do that.
                        One of the main difficulties that we encountered in this project was to be autonomous because, until that year’s project, we were always supervised. We encountered some other problems too, one of our teammates decided to leave the project and let us on our own. Consequently, we had to reorganize all the roles in the team, and we also needed to speed up to be on schedule. However, we still managed to reach the target and pass the exams. I developed not only so much technical knowledge but also some soft skills like being autonomous, being consistent in work, etc.
